# Battery-Dispatch-to-load-independence
#This script is an optimization problem to maximize the energy that the battery charges and discharges for supplying energy to a load. It thus minimizes the dependence on the grid, so not necessarily the most cost effective strategy or profitable one, it just miximizes the independence
The Model considered that the power is activated at the beginning of the hour and that the SOC is the one also at the beginning of each hour. It assumes that the initial and final SOC is zero but it can be changed.
